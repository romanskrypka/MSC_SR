                    <h3>Meta Side Table</h3>
                    <p>The Meta Side Table is one of our <br> 
                       signature pieces and well suited to all <br>
                       communal living spaces and bedrooms. <br>
                       Consisting of a series of arranged, <br>
                       powder coated rectangular and circular <br>
                       shapes, Meta’s appearance changes from <br>
                       delicate and thin, to substantial and full <br>
                       depending on the viewing angle. <br>
                       Featuring multi-directional storage for <br>
                       your reading material and an even top for <br>
                       decorative accessories.</p>

                    <h3>Click Shelf</h3>
                    <p>Click is a boltless shelving system. The <br>
                        minimalistic form and construction, as <br>
                        well as the visual lightness, form the <br>
                        aesthetic characteristics of the shelf. <br>
                        Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel, a <br>
                        girder and shelves, the system functions <br>
                        similar to a construction kit. Only four <br>
                        screws fix the girder together to which <br>
                        the shelves are simply hung up without <br>
                        any tools. The material and precision of <br>
                        the components guarantee the stability <br>
                        and assembly.</P>

                    <h3>Float Shelf</h3>
                    <p>Designed as a versatile storage option, <br>
                       the Float Shelf is open to diverse <br>
                       interpretations – holding a book as a <br>
                       bedside or side table, bearing weight as <br>
                       wall console, storing a magazine <br>
                       collection, serving as a compact standing <br>
                       desk, or safeguarding small personal <br>
                       essentials as a hallway tray. The Float <br>
                       Shelf equally adds a touch of character to <br>
                       hotel rooms, boutique accommodation <br>
                       and boardinghouses. Embodying purity <br>
                       at its most elegant degree, the strict <br>
                       geometry of this wall-mounted shelf <br>
                       lends its form a sculptural appeal. The <br>
                       Float Shelf consists of two offset levels <br>
                       cut from a single sheet of aluminum, <br>
                       with a simple two-fold composition <br>
                       allowing for flexible placement, use and <br>
                       display. Referencing the reduced <br>
                       aesthetic principles of modernism in the <br>
                       Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the <br>
                       essence of a shelf.</p>
